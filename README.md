# ✍️ AI-Based Hybrid Handwritten Word Recognition System

This project is a deep learning–based web application that recognizes handwritten words from uploaded images and converts them into digital text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Flask web framework.

The system is trained on handwritten character images and predicts characters one by one, then combines them to form a word.
